Mobile app that notifies users when to hydrate

# How does it Work?

A user must first register the application and create a profile by filling out some basic information. Body weight and age are basic pieces of information. To log into the app, a user can use either a Google account or any other social media account. Furthermore, the user specifies a start and end time for their water consumption tracking. Based on the information, the app will calculate the amount of water you require throughout the day and notify you when the time comes. However, you must log into the app every time you consume water or any other liquid.
